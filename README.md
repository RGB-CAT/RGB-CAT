## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Here's a little introduction:
- I'm a co-founder of [@ScriptGuild](https://github.com/ScriptGuild) alongside [@Synthvara](https://github.com/Synthvara).
- I work at [Cat Client](https://github.com/CatClientMC), [ScriptGuild](https://github.com/ScriptGuild), and the [ScriptGuild Cybersecurity Division](https://github.com/ScriptGuild-CSD).
- Here, my primary focus is on creating projects to protect vulnerable communities&mdash;like the LGBTQIA2S+ and Furry communities&mdash;with a side interest in Web3. Occasionally, I also publish random stuff like bootloaders and kernels.
- Also, I like red foxes, raccoons, and cats&mdash;hence the display name "RGB CAT :3".

### Here are my favorite projects :3
- [Linus Torvald's Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
- [Oven.sh's Bun Runtime](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)
